        Sorry to interrupt. Update Notification from your Temporary Containers Add-on.

      <div class="content">
        We had to change a preference/option that was default before with this update to version 0.58:
        If you open New Tabs then those tabs will now automatically get reopened in Temporary Containers.<br>
        <br>
        If you want the old behavior of reopening Websites on first navigation in new tabs back, you can change
        it in the <a href="../options.html" target="_blank">preferences/options</a> under
        "Advanced -> Automatic Mode" (at the bottom). It now has a warning attached which reads
        as follows and is the reason for this change and notification:<br>
        <div class="ui message">
          New Tabs (about:newtab and about:blank) can make network requests and set cookies, especially when you
          use the address bar for search engines. If you select "Don't reopen New Tabs in Temporary Containers"
          here, cookies can get written into and read from the permanent default container as long as the new
          tab didn't get reopened in a Temporary Container.<br>
          <br>
          If you have a Cookie-Deletion-Add-on that automatically keeps your default/permanent containers clean
          and you use privacy-oriented search-engines like Startpage.com or DuckDuckGo then it should be no problem
          to use the "Don't reopen New Tabs" preference.

        Thanks for your attention.
