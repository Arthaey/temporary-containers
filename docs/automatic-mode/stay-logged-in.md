# How to stay logged in?

You can use the official [Multi-Account Containers Add-on from Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) to keep data (like cookies) from some websites in permanent containers and with that stay logged in. Then you can easily leave "Automatic Mode" enabled, which is preferable from a privacy-perspective.
