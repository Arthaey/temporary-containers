# Multi-Account Containers

### Open new Temporary Containers if a Permanent Container Tab tries to load a Domain that isn't assigned to "Always open in" that container

**`Enabled:`** If you have the [Multi-Account Containers Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) installed then it's only possible to load URLs in Permanent Containers whose Domain is assigned to `Always open in` in Multi-Account Containers. Subdomains can't be matched and will also get isolated.
