# Automatic Mode

Automatically reopen Tabs in new Temporary Containers when
* Opening a new Tab
* A Tab tries to load a Link in the Default Container
* An external Program opens a Link in the Browser

In combination with [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
* Reopens Confirm Page if in Default Container so you can choose between Temporary Container and Permanent Container

*Note:*
- If you experience a huge delay when new tabs are reopened, maybe even losing typed characters in the address bar, you can change the *Automatic Mode* configuration in the *Advanced* section to `Don't reopen [..] but instead on navigation`.
